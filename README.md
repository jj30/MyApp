This is a two-activity, functioning example of using the same navigation drawer in all activities. 

This is for marshmallow 23. Other online examples won't work for varying reasonse. Also, for newbies, the navigation activity used is 
the one that comes boxed with Android Studio (add Activity --> select navigation drawer activity), which implements a listener to the
widget.
